tiles likely need to implement an interface called Playable (or if you have a better name)
that should have a method called play() which happens when a player lands on a tile at the position they moveTo()
players move from tile to tile
the regular Tile does nothign on play()
other tiles may do other things to players
maximum number of players per tile -- likely needs to be set on the board
some function needs to check to make sure this limit is kept -- prevents overcrowding
different boards will have different maximum numbers
boards will be how we incorporate "levels" into the gameplay
the function to check if a player is able to move to a particular tile may need to be on the board
add other suggestions as you see fit, make sure to use lombok
