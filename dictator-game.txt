Application - contains the levels, board, tiles, and players - logic to transition each

Game - variant of the dictator game, determines the rules and what moves can be made

Player - logged in user, can be a dictator or citizen (or maybe other positions) - has private information and can make some of it public to play higher levels

Turn - cycle by each player, allowing them to make a move if one is avialble to them - if a player disappears, then the default move is made for them during their turn

Move - decision made by players (in some games, only certain players can make moves, and only certain types of moves exist)

Board - entire surface of the game, where players can end up; different levels have different boards

Tile - specific "games" that can be played, players move between tiles -- in games where multiple players are used, then players on the same tile can come together into a game


Rules
- dictators rise a level after winning all tiles in a level 
- tile position chosen randomly (or maybe not)
- winning a tile usually means giving or receiving a certain percentage of the endowment during that turn compared to everyone ever -- so for example, you can either give give more than most people or receive more than most people, in that turn, to win

there are many variants to the game, and they can be played in progression as players win (and advance in their level) and move around tiles on a board (for that level) 

turns are timed -- universally -- pegged to UTC
each turn at the lowest level is 60 seconds (1 minute)
each level the turns get shorter in time, perhaps up to 10 seconds
