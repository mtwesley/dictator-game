# Dictator Game

## Overview
This project will provide multiple implementations of the Dictator Game, a classic experiment in behavioral economics, designed as a multiplayer online game. It allows players to assume the roles of dictators or citizens, making decisions that affect the allocation of resources among participants. The game will features multiple levels, tiles, and dynamic roles, providing a rich platform for exploring decision-making, strategy, and social dynamics in an economic context.

## Objectives
- *Multiplayer support:* Engage multiple players in decision-making processes in real time.
- *Role dynamics:* Players can be dictators, citizens, or other positions with unique capabilities and restrictions.
- *Level progression:* Players advance through levels by winning tiles, each level with its own board layout and set of challenges.
- *Turn-based gameplay:* Players are given an opportunity to make moves sequentially to ensure fair and orderly participation for all players.
- *Data-driven improvements:* Decisions and outcomes are stored privately to improve future gameplay.
